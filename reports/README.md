# Reports

## Formal Problem Statemet (FPS)

This report contains detailed information about the problem, the project, project's scope, usage, stakeholders, success factors, risks, deployment options, project plan and cost estimate.

## Collect and Shape Data

This report explains the main dataset for the development of the model, where it came from and what it contains and what steps were taken to prepre the data. The report also explains the auxilary data obtained from the Census.gov which was used to supplement the main dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This report explains the steps we took to analyze the data, understand the correlations between the features and how they relate to the dependent variable, the Credit Limit.

## Model Performance Evaluation

This report examines the most basic and the simplest model, aka the Naive Model, which we can build for our problem. We will gauge the performance of the models we build against this baseline to track our progress.

## Feature Selection

This report explains the process we used to determine which independent vaiables were the most significant solving the problem and how we have evaluated each variable's contribution to the fitness of the model.

## Model Training and Validation

This report explains various models that we have built to solve the problem, how we have trained and tested these models, and the performance evaluations of these models against the metric that we identified in our Formal Problem Statement document. Click [here](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/hakanegeli/csx415-project/blob/master/reports/05-training-and-validation.html) to view the report 05-training-and-validation.html, and the comparison of all the models that we have built, and the model we selected to deploy as a solution.
